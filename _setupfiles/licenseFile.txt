TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a 
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers 
to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either 
the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a 
work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, 
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) 
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered 
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent 
of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends 
on what the Program does.


1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of 
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.


2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions:

 
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to
be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms 
of this License.
 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, 
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying 
that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not 
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights
to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right 
to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
